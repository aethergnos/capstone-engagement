### Capstone Engagement: Red vs Blue Project

The Capstone Engagement is a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which the roles of both pentester and SOC analyst were performed. 
As the Red Team, a vulnerable VM within this controlled environment was attacked, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 
As Blue Team, Kibana was used to review logs taken during the previous engagement. The logs were then used to extract hard data and visualizations for the final report.
Lastly, the log data was interpreted to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that was successfully performed.

This project demonstrates knowledge and application of the following skills and tools: 
- Penetration tesing with Kali Linux
- Log and incident analysis with Kibana
- System hardening and configuration
- Reporting, documentation and communication
